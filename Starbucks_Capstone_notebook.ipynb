    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

    "16,994 unique customers and 10 unique offers are represented in this dataset, which gives 169,940 total mix of possible offers. Around 63% offers are `unsent`, most likely because it was identified that offers do not fulfill the needs of specific customers or the opportunity was misinterpreted and therefore missed, which is the gap that we need to fill in this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "When considering those offers that were actually sent, about 52% turned out incomplete, which means offers did not influenced customers to purchase."

    "To this point, we have performed exploratory analysis on individual and merged datasets and conducted machine learning to build a classifier model. We would like to find how customers have interacted with differnt offers and finally to predict if offers would be completed or not when particular offers were sent to customers with different characteristics.\n",

    "Furthermore, we have identified a matrix of 169,940 possible interactions between customers an offer types from 16,994 unique customers and 10 different offers (refer to `transcript_labled` data). 63% of them are labeled unsent possibly because the previous business decisions identified that some offers would not match customers with certain characterstics, resources(time, costs, etc.) were limited or just by chance.\n",
    "\n",

    "Offers were grouped into three categories: bogo, discount and informational. bogo and discount are transactional following the below funnel and offers are considered completion if customers reponsed to all :\n",
    "\n",
    "    offer received -> offer viewed -> purchased -> offer completed\n",

    "### Insights gained from the exploatory analysis:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>About offers</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amongst the three offer categories, discount offers are the most difficult to redeem (on average 11.75) but have the longest duration allowing customers to be influenced the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The two informational offers named as `info000003` and `info000004` recorded high completion rate above 60%. Especially, 'info000003' had the extremrely high completion rate (around 90%) despite a slightly shorter duration than the other. It was found that this different may come from communication channels: other than email and mobile, 'info000003' distributed on social media as opposed web that 'info000004' used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two transactional offers marked above 60% completion rate and they both fall into discount category. Although these two offers are more difficult to redeem (with less rewards given), they have higher duration and wider distribution across all existing channels so customers were exposed and influenced more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: the offer name follows the convention using the first 4 letters of'offer_type', 2 digits of respective 'reward', 'difficulty', 'duration'.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>About demographics</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Of those offers sent, 47% were copmleted indicating that customers viewed offers and made purchases (bogo / disount) or were made aware of offers (informational).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Female customers have higher completion rate than male customers (53% vs 45%).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Offer completion rate is lower than 50% for age groups below 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Income groups bewteen 80k and 100k have the highest completion rate (60%). It marked at least 40% completion rate across all income groups.\n",
